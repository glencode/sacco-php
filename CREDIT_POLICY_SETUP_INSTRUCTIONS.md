# Credit Policy Setup Instructions

## Issue
The credit policy page was showing "Policy Not Available" because no policy has been published in the database yet.

## Solution
I've added an automated setup feature to the admin interface that allows you to quickly create and publish a sample credit policy.

## How to Set Up the Credit Policy

### Method 1: Using the Admin Interface (Recommended)

1. **Log in to WordPress Admin** as an administrator
2. **Navigate to the Policy Management page**:
   - Go to the WordPress admin dashboard
   - Look for "Policy Management" in the admin menu (it should be under the Daystar admin section)
   - Or go directly to: `your-site.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=daystar-admin-policy`

3. **Set up the sample policy**:
   - You'll see a notice saying "No policy versions found"
   - Click the blue button "Set up sample policy automatically"
   - Confirm when prompted
   - The system will create and publish a comprehensive sample credit policy

4. **Verify the setup**:
   - Visit the credit policy page: `your-site.com/credit-policy/`
   - You should now see the full policy content instead of the "Policy Not Available" message

### Method 2: Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to create the policy manually:

1. Go to Policy Management â†’ Create New Version
2. Fill in:
   - **Title**: "Daystar SACCO Credit Policy"
   - **Version**: "1.0"
   - **Content**: Copy the content from `includes/sample-policy-content.php`
3. Click "Create Policy Version"
4. Click "Publish" to make it live

## What the Sample Policy Includes

The sample policy includes comprehensive sections covering:

- Introduction and objectives
- Loan eligibility criteria
- Application process
- Credit assessment criteria
- Loan approval authority
- Interest rates and charges
- Loan disbursement procedures
- Repayment terms
- Loan recovery procedures
- Guarantors and collateral requirements
- Regulatory compliance
- Risk management
- Appeals process

## Features Available After Setup

Once the policy is published, users can:

- **View the policy online** with a clean, accessible interface
- **Download PDF copies** (HTML format for now)
- **Print the policy** with print-optimized styling
- **Share the policy** using the share functionality
- **Navigate easily** with the table of contents
- **Provide feedback** on policy helpfulness

## Admin Features

As an administrator, you can:

- **Create new policy versions** for updates
- **Compare different versions** to see changes
- **Archive old policies** when they're superseded
- **View audit trails** of all policy changes
- **Generate downloadable documents**
- **Manage member notifications** for policy updates

## Database Tables Created

The system automatically creates these tables:
- `wp_daystar_policy_versions` - Stores policy versions
- `wp_daystar_policy_audit_log` - Tracks all policy changes

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check user permissions**: Make sure you're logged in as an administrator
2. **Verify database tables**: The system should create tables automatically
3. **Check for errors**: Look in the WordPress error logs if something fails
4. **Clear cache**: If using caching plugins, clear the cache after setup

## Next Steps

After setting up the policy:

1. **Review the content** and customize it for your specific SACCO requirements
2. **Test the download functionality** to ensure it works properly
3. **Inform members** about the availability of the online policy
4. **Set up regular review schedules** for policy updates

## File Locations

Key files involved in this system:
- `page-credit-policy.php` - Frontend policy display
- `includes/policy-management.php` - Core policy management logic
- `includes/admin/admin-policy-management.php` - Admin interface
- `includes/sample-policy-content.php` - Sample policy content
- `assets/css/pages/page-credit-policy.css` - Policy page styling
