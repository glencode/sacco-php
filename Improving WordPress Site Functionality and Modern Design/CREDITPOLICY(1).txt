CREDIT POLICY

    1.0 PREAMBLE

Section 79 states that there shall be a loan policy to govern the administration of all loans given by the society.

The following is the loan policy governing the Credit Committee of Daystar Multipurpose Co-operative Society Ltd.

    2.0 GENERAL PRINCIPLES

    1. All members shall be treated equally as regards to loans subject to the rules and regulations set out in this policy.
    2. For one to be eligible to apply for a loan he/she has to be a member of the society for the six months and must have contributed consistently not less than 12,000/=(2,000*6) and is willing to continue being a member in the foreseeable future.
    3. One must own a minimum of ksh 5,000 as share capital or 250 shares worth 200 shillings each. These shares are only transferable incase one ceases to be a member.
    4. Loan applications shall be processed on the basis of first come first serve basis
    5. One must have definite productive activity or show certain economic income to ensure that the loan repayments will be promptly and consistently.
    6. One must possess satisfactory, measurable and legal security for borrowing.
    7. One must have adequate good credit history for borrowing especially for special products.
    8. The aggregate loan that a member can be granted at any one time shall not exceed Two million (2,000,000) for development loans and ksh 3,000,000 for super saver loans.
    9. Loans are granted on understanding that the member is able to repay the loan with interest and in the period stipulated and his/her failure to repay mean that his/her guarantors will stand in as sureties otherwise all other reasonable means will be used to recover the granted loans (principal+interest).
    10. All loans will attract interest rate of 12% p.a on a reducing balance. Except for special loans which will attract 5 %( reducing balance). Salary Advance will attract 10% for one month and 5% for compounded if one decides to take pay for more than one month. In addition a Processing fee of ksh 200 will be charged as processing fee, 1% sinking fund (Insurance) and 1% appraisal fee respectively for all loans except salary advances and special loans.

    11. The management, after due consideration, may refuse to grant a loan to member, but reason(s) for refusal will be given to a member so affected in writing without delay.

    12. The loan factor will be three (3) times the members deposits irrespective of the terms of employment whether part time, contract or permanent.

    13. The repayment period is as follows;	

            i. Part Timers& Permanent- 36 months Maximum
            ii. Others -24 Months Maximum
            iii. Supersavers -48 Months Maximum
    14. Part time teaching will be considered in calculating the amount available for deduction hence a constant amount of ksh 10,000 will be added across the board whether a lecturer teaches undergraduate or postgraduate classes. For other permanent staff, 50% net after tax for Responsibility Allowance, Telephone Allowance & H.O.D Allowance will be considered in calculating the amount available for deduction.
