# Login and Registration System Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive approach for implementing a secure, user-friendly, and policy-compliant login and registration system for the Daystar Multi-Purpose Co-op Society website. The plan addresses the requirements identified in the credit policy document and resolves the gaps found in the current implementation.

## System Architecture

### Authentication Framework

The login and registration system will be built using a hybrid approach that leverages WordPress's native user management capabilities while extending them with custom functionality specific to the cooperative's requirements:

1. **WordPress User Integration**
   
   The system will utilize WordPress's user management as the foundation, benefiting from its security features, password hashing, and session management. This approach provides a stable base while allowing for customization through user meta fields and custom tables.

2. **Custom Member Profile Extension**
   
   A custom member profile system will extend the standard WordPress user profiles to include cooperative-specific information such as member number, contribution history, share capital, employment details, and loan eligibility status. This will be implemented through a combination of user meta fields and custom database tables for complex relational data.

3. **Role-Based Access Control**
   
   A comprehensive role system will be implemented with the following roles:
   - **Member**: Regular cooperative members with access to personal dashboard and loan applications
   - **Credit Committee**: Users who can review and approve loan applications
   - **CMC Member**: Users with higher-level approval authority
   - **Administrator**: System administrators with full access to all features
   
   Each role will have carefully defined permissions aligned with the credit policy's governance structure.

## Registration Process

The registration process will be enhanced to ensure compliance with membership requirements and proper data collection:

### Multi-step Registration Flow

1. **Step 1: Personal Information**
   
   The existing personal information collection will be retained but enhanced with:
   - Stronger validation for ID numbers and phone numbers using Kenya-specific formats
   - Email verification through a confirmation link
   - Duplicate checking to prevent multiple registrations

2. **Step 2: Employment Information**
   
   The employment information section will be enhanced to:
   - Include specific fields for Daystar University staff to indicate department and employment type
   - Capture employment verification documents through secure file upload
   - Implement intelligent validation based on employment type (part-time, permanent, contract)

3. **Step 3: Financial Information**
   
   A new section will be added to capture:
   - Initial contribution commitment (minimum KSh 12,000 as per policy)
   - Share capital purchase (minimum KSh 5,000 / 250 shares as per policy)
   - Preferred payment method for contributions
   - Bank account details for potential disbursements

4. **Step 4: Account Setup**
   
   The account setup section will be enhanced with:
   - Stronger password requirements (minimum 10 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
   - Security questions for account recovery
   - Terms and conditions specific to the cooperative's policies
   - Privacy policy acknowledgment

### Server-side Processing

1. **Registration Submission**
   
   When a registration form is submitted, the system will:
   - Validate all data on the server side to prevent manipulation
   - Create a WordPress user with a "Pending Member" status
   - Generate a unique member number following the cooperative's numbering scheme
   - Store all profile information in the appropriate database tables
   - Create initial records for contribution tracking

2. **Verification Process**
   
   After submission, the system will:
   - Send a verification email to confirm the email address
   - Generate a verification page for the administrator to review
   - Create a pending payment record for initial contribution and share capital
   - Notify the administrative staff about the new registration

3. **Activation Process**
   
   Member accounts will be activated when:
   - Email verification is completed
   - Initial contribution and share capital payments are confirmed
   - Administrative approval is granted
   
   Upon activation, the user's status will change from "Pending Member" to "Active Member," and they will gain access to the member dashboard.

## Login System

The login system will be enhanced to provide secure, user-friendly access while enforcing policy requirements:

### Authentication Process

1. **Primary Authentication**
   
   The login form will be enhanced to:
   - Accept either member number or email address as the identifier

   - Allow for session termination across devices

3. **Access Control**
   
   After successful authentication, the system will:
   - Verify the user's membership status before granting access
   - Direct users to appropriate dashboards based on their role
   - Restrict access to features based on eligibility (e.g., loan applications)
   - Display personalized notifications and alerts

### Password Recovery

1. **Recovery Process**
   
   The password recovery system will:
   - Verify identity through email and security questions
